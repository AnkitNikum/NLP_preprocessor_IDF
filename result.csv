1,"Korean cooking variety shows have found a niche following over time and this one happens to have included a Recording Academy winner  Earlier known for being veteran actress Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s cooking show under the name &lsquo;Youn&#39;s Kitchen&rsquo;, a spin-off series has been planned  Actor Lee Seo Jin who was one of the cast members in the second season of the show, airing from January to March 2018, will be the central character this time around 

Na Young Seok PD who is known to have been the mastermind behind multiple popular Korean variety shows including &lsquo;2 Days &amp; 1 Night&rsquo;, &lsquo;New Journey to the West&rsquo;, &lsquo;Three Meals a Day&rsquo; as well as &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; as well as its earlier spin-off show &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, is said to be returning for this season of &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Seojin&rsquo;s premiere date

Earlier today, it was reported by Korean media outlets that the new restaurant variety show is in its last phase of post-production  They are said to be eyeing an early February date for the broadcast  While nothing has been confirmed, it is reported that the show will air every Friday  While the two seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; spanned over 9 and 11 episodes each, &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; had 12 episodes  A similar timeline is expected for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; 

Cast for Seojin&rsquo;s

It was confirmed that the cast lineup for &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; would include actor Lee Seo Jin, actress Jung Yu Mi, best friends and former &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; cast mates Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik  This time, however, they will be joined by another member of the famed Wooga Squad  BTS&rsquo; V has reportedly been roped in to join the cast for this spin-off show  With such a sparkling team at its disposal, &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; may as well become one of the biggest and most anticipated variety show releases of the year 

Take a look at the reasons why &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is set on the path to success 

The concept of Seojin&rsquo;s

It is known that unlike &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; which looked to promote Korean dishes through its program, this spin-off will also include lighter options for the global audience  Earlier, it was reported that the show has been shot in Mexico this season following the international filming locations of Indonesia and Spain for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo;, followed by a domestic shoot in Jeonnam in 2020 for &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; 

Na PD&rsquo;s charm

A popular name in the industry, Na Young Seok PD is known to be level-headed and strict when it comes to conducting variety shows  He is hardly ever swayed by the charm of the cast before him and sticks to rules  At the same time, he creates amazingly enjoyable shows which receive great viewership ratings by adding fun segments, dire situations and unbelievable twists  &lsquo;Seojin&rsquo;s&rsquo; is expected to bring his magic to the table 

Popular participants

Actor Lee Seo Jin who has been present for both the seasons of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Kitchen&rsquo; and one season of &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo; is familiar with the overarching concept  It was observed that he was of great help during those shows and brings experience as well as leadership to the show  Turning it to focus on him after Youn Yuh Jung&rsquo;s decision to depart may become a successful change if he manages to pull off the role  Much like Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi has also been a part of the earlier three seasons and brings her own understanding to the show &nbsp;

Actors Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik are best friends off-camera and jokesters on camera  They have a tried and tested chemistry which was previously seen in &lsquo;Youn&rsquo;s Stay&rsquo;, &lsquo;Summer Vacation&rsquo;, &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo; and &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo;  This time the two will be joined by BTS member V who was seen leaving for Mexico as well as spotted alongside Park Seo Joon during a restaurant visit there  The K-pop icon confirmed his participation in the show by sharing a photo from the shoot where he could be seen staring at the bright moon with a shirt with actor Lee Seo Jin&rsquo;s caricature 
V for Victory

While BTS member V is known to not have a lot of skills in cooking, as previously seen during the group&rsquo;s activities including his memorable &lsquo;squirrel plate&rsquo; incident in &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;, he brings charm wherever he goes  A certified &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; his synergy with the other cast members will be looked out for  He goes into &lsquo;maknae mode&rsquo; around his hyungs Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik which was very visible throughout &lsquo;IN THE SOOP: Friendcation&rsquo; and so it will be interesting to see him back with them, though this time actor Park Hyung Sik and singer Peakboy will not be present

6,"Bangchan or Christopher Bang was born on October 3, 1997 in Seoul, South Korea. He is the leader, producer, songwriter, composer, lead vocalist, rapper and dancer of Stray Kids. In 2010, at the age of 13, he passed a local audition in Australia for the K-pop label JYP Entertainment. Despite his young age, he moved to Korea to train at JYPE. Today's heartwarming letter in our Dear Oppa series has been penned by Shruti from India to Stray Kids’ Bangchan. Read her letter below.Dear Bang Chan,I  still vividly remember the first video that made me a fan of yours. Even though it's the 21st century, talking about periods is not something what many men do, leave alone a male kpop idol. But YOU did. Fearlessly! Not caring about how controversial it might turn out to be. Little did I know that one video would change my life for the better. From being a naive 13 year old teen who left his country and trained hard for 7 years to becoming the leader of one of the most popular 4th Gen groups, you've proved time and again that you're indeed the ""best leader"". Your genius and talent never ceases to amaze and inspire me. The dedication you have towards your profession, your members and your fans is everything. ""Chan's Room"" has now become a comfort place for me and I would be lying if I say I do not wait for the weekends for those ""big hugs"". If I had to name one thing that I learned from you then that would be ""kindness"". The way you genuinely care for every single individual around you, make them feel comfortable and most importantly put them before yourself, not only shows your big heart but also how compassionate you are as a person. From encouraging us to be proud of the little demon that resides within us to comforting us by saying it's okay to cry and let it out to giving tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety, you've truly been a Guardian angel for us Stays. Honestly, I could go on talking about how much your kindness has given me the strength to endure these hard times, not just me but Stays and every other person who looks up to you. I truly hope that the next time you take a Buzzfeed quiz, the answer to ""Do you love yourself?"" would be a genuine YES accompanied with that dimpled smile. Sending you lots of warm hugs and hot chocolate.

8,"A BTS fan on Instagram asked Jungkook, “Tell us why Jungkookie changed his ID!” Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @sebyul, ""Because it was too long…” When a fan suggested that he go for 'boxing with Taehyungie (V) hyung (brother)', Jungkook said, ""He’s no match for me.” A person also said, “Yoongi-yah (Suga), please marry me” and Jungkook replied, ""Hello, I’m Yoongi?” When asked if he will dye his hair soon, Jungkook said, ""I don’t have any plans [to dye my hair] yet.” When a fan teased the BTS member saying, “Jungkook, do your feet hurt?

Like, How can I handle something this big right now? I would always feel discouraged, but my personality has changed a lot now, I think. I think the biggest change in my mind is that now, even if there’s a major project in the works, I think I can do it now. Now, instead of, 'How can I handle this?' it’s 'I can handle this!' when I’m making songs for other people to listen to.""

I said to J-Hope, 'Since you know how to play tennis, do you want to come with me to go play with my friends?' So I made him come with me, and I remember I beat him. It wasn't like my technique was incredible. Probably more that J-Hope hasn't played in a while which I'm thinking is what was the issue."" Jin also spoke about gaming, ""I started gaming when I was in elementary school. But it was in middle school that I started playing passionately. V is the member who's best at playing games. Even if he hasn't played the game that much, he'll understand the game really fast...J-Hope is the worst. He has no interest in games. He's the opposite of V. He can't really understand the game itself. I tried to make him play, so one time I went over to him with a bunch of games. I showed him and said, 'This is how you play' and left. Later, when I went back, the game was still at the same spot I'd left it. So I gave up."" In the interview, he also spoke about ten items that are essential for him. They include--Minions-themed tennis bag, wallet, his designed PJs, flip phone, trousers, gaming keyboard, key ring, bag and slippers.

Elon Musk&rsquo;s Twitter

The Tesla and SpaceX boss, Elon Musk expressed his wish to own Twitter earlier in the year and after many hurdles and disputes, was able to buy the social media platform  He recently expressed his wish to pass on the baton by appointing someone new as the CEO, as he left the decision to a poll  Suggestions came pouring in with some suitable and some downright hilarious options of people who could lead the platform efficiently 

BTS as Twitter CEOs

It was DJ Swivel, the Canadian music producer who has previously worked with BTS on multiple tracks, writing, and remixing them for the members and the group as a whole, who had the brilliant idea  He tweeted, &ldquo;I think @BTS_twt should become the joint Twitter CEO&rsquo;s @elonmusk &ldquo; tagging the BTS members&rsquo; account and Elon Musk being as hands-on as ever replied with, &ldquo;Great idea&rdquo; 

RM&rsquo;s reaction

BTS&rsquo; leader RM who is known to be lurking on social media all the time found the tweet and seemed to have let out a laugh at the interaction  He shared the exchange on his Instagram story with a laughing emoji  RM did not seem averse to the idea, so when can we expect the change, Mr  Elon Musk?

As per Korean rules, Jin has to enlist by the end of 2022. So, a world tour with Kim Seokjin is what everyone is hoping and praying for. As we know, there is a rumour that they will tour 30 plus nations for their world tour. From multiple cities in the US to 10 countries in Asia, everyone is hoping that their nation is on the list BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, J-Hope, Jungkook and V are hugely popular in Asia. The countries that are almost reportedly confirmed are Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Singapore and maybe China. There are slots left for four other countries. It seems it will be decided on a number of factors. Given the kind of streaming done from India, fans are hoping that India makes it to the list. Now, even the name of Pakistan has come up. Check out this video below This is a real surprise. The fan base of BTS in Pakistan is growing by the day. We saw birthday ads for Jimin, V and Jin at various cities like Karachi and Multan.

20,"K-Pop is synonymous with fan wars. BLACKPINK's Blinks and TWICE's Onces have been embroiled in a heated debate on social media ever since the Dahyun incident. It so happened that Kim Da-Hyun was doing a live with her fans when Lisa's music video, Lalisa came. As we know, it is one of the biggest K-Pop hits of 2021-22. The song is a bop and Lisa has picked up awards for the same. Da-hyun was playing songs of TWICE for fans when she skipped the music video of Lalisa that apparently came as an ad. This did not go down well with a certain section of Blackpink fandom. As per some Blinks, Da-hyun apparently lied that she did not have YT Premium account After that incident, tempers of TWICE and BLACKPINK fans rose on social media. As we know, verbal slurs on Twitter can be very derogatory and both fandoms slugged it out.

23,"BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

BTS in the beginning:

After launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group&#39;s second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;

BTS&#39; achievements:&nbsp;

BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite. Their follow-up releases Savage Love, Life Goes On, Butter, and Permission to Dance made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.

BTS in 2022:

As of 2022, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in excess of 30 million albums via the Circle Chart, and their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to hold sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#39;s (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021.

33,"As translated by Twitter user, @rmkkyu, Suga said, ""Jeon Jungkook, for a few days, whenever he sees me, he goes 야 내가 (the start of his rap in That That) and then (shows the first dance move from That That’s chorus) dances around like this."" ""The members repeated the dance moves a lot. Jeon Jungkook makes fun of whatever you do so but I'd end up laughing every time (Jungkook followed Yoongi's choreo). The members monitored the music video a lot for me. I was in the middle of filming when it came out so they told me then I couldn't watch (the MV). It was the same around Daechwita, I can't really watch the MV I'm on as much,"" Twitter user @BTStranslation_ quoted Suga. Suga also said, as translated by @rmkkyu, ""Originally, I was only going to feature, only feature in the music video. I was only going to feature and then leave but… one thing led to another, I danced.""

As translated by @BTStranslation_ , Suga had sent another song to PSY which he said no to at first. The song was detailed but PSY wanted to do a different style, so they ended up doing That That. Suga wrote the hook/chorus That That I Like That and PSY wrote the other parts. That That, part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th, released on April 29 and has been produced by Suga. Talking about the collaboration with PSY, Suga had said as quoted by news agency ANI, ""At first, because he's many years my senior and someone who's well-respected in the business I was quite nervous. It felt like working with a childhood friend so it made the songwriting process that much more fun. We became besties in a way."" The album has 12 songs, including one featuring Korean-Canadian rapper Tablo. Meanwhile, BTS' logo trailer for their new album, titled Proof, was released recently. The new album will have a mix of new and old songs and will be an anthology album. In a statement, BigHit Music had said, “After ceaselessly sprinting forward since 2013, BTS is celebrating their 9th anniversary this coming June. It is all thanks to ARMY who have sent us your unwavering love and support. The BTS anthology album that embodies the history of BTS will be released as they begin a new chapter as an artist that has been active for nine years to look back on their past endeavours."" It added, “The anthology album Proof that consists of three CDs includes many different tracks - including three all-new tracks - that reflect the thoughts and ideas of the members on the past, present and future of BTS.

37,"This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here's a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore."" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time."" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.",,year included several first bts making big moment group. year come end take brief journey major achievement big moment bts year. year started several bts member facing health issue contracted covid19. jin jimin even underwent finger appendix surgery respectively ahead concert seoul first home ground two years. heres recap big moment bts two thousand twentytwo one concerts seoul las vegas busan bts’ permission dance stageseoul concert held march. significant first time bts concert inperson audience city two half years. bts next held permission dance stage concert las vegas april. first concert came day ahead performance grammys. bts also held first free concert busan october. show bts appeared without additional fee hybe invested personal fund concert. two bts member grammys seven member performed 64th grammy awards april first inperson performance received standing ovation. ahead show bts member contracted covid19 jin could partially perform due surgery. performance saw member pulling museum heist single butter. three bts break fans left shocked heartbroken festa dinner group announced hiatus. suga said video dinner per english subtitle “so we’ve entered offseason. we’re going hiatus now.” later added “it’s like we’re disbanding. live want do...writing lyric hardest. message want give nothing come anymore. later quoted bighits clarification “bts taking hiatus. members focusing solo project time. jungkook also issued clarification hiatus. four bts album proof group released anthology album proof june. album 3cd collection bts’ hit old well new songs. proof included three new songsyet come run bts born singer. old hit need run fire fake love persona moon also part album. released day ninth debut anniversary june ten. five bts white house group attended white house press briefing may discus antiasian hate crimes. made history private meeting president joe biden white house first time ever. invited white house celebration asian american native hawaiian pacific islanders heritage month aanhpi heritage month. president surprised member playing butter oval office discussion make feel home. six bts military enlistment south korea rule mandatory military service ablebodied men twentyeight. kpop star granted ability defer enrolment thirty. bts army always dreaded time member spend month military. year october bighit music announced military enlistment begin eldest member jin. membersrm suga jhope jimin aka kim taehyung jungkook follow him. group reconvene two thousand twentyfive. though fan wished well news left emotional. apart bts also made comeback variety show run bts ten months. fans saw member solo project jimin singing kdrama blues suga produced featured psy suga jungkook came stay alive jungkook treated fan you. collaboration continued jungkook charlie puths left right jhope crushs rush hour jin coldplays astronaut. jhope released first album jack box performed lollapalooza unveiled first album indigo. jungkook became first asian artist perform fifa world cup two thousand twentytwo qatar..

The 13 member group is known for their talent in music production. In fact, other than BTS they are one of the most successful boy groups around. An American channel interviewed them and asked Seventeen if they imagined that they would be as successful as BTS when they made their debut. Now, BTS made their debut in 2013 while Seventeen made their entry in 2015. Both the groups have members who are passionate about music production Seventeen gave an interview to the channel Sirius XM and the interviewer asked them, ""When you started the band, there’s no way you expected that you’d be up there just like BTS. That you’d be at the same level as BTS."" Vernon aka Choi Hansol who was taking most of the questions replied in a very mature and graceful manner. He said, ""When we debuted, BTS wasn’t the BTS today either. So, it’s really crazy what we’re doing right now and where we are at right now."" He is not factually incorrect. BTS started making headlines in the West after 2016. Moreover, the comparison question was totally uncalled for. Both the groups are super talented and passionate as performers However, some sections of ARMY and Carats are dragging the issue on social media. The former feels that Vernon could have shown some more respect to BTS who are their seniors. Carats feel Vernon was right in his own way. Neutral fans feel that BTS members are pals with Seventeen so there is no need to diss one another. Take a look at the tweets Vernon aka Choi Hansol is a Korean-American rapper.

group in a post on Instagram  Both Lenka and Gabriela will be in Seoul for next few months for practice so that the group brings out their next album  In the last 5 months, the two were put to intense

Goodbye Rania, followed by its first single album Close to Me in 2021 Lenka, who has learnt Odissi classical dance as well as freestyle, hip-hop and contemporary dance since the age of 12, got hooked to K-pop like millions of Indian teenagers  Her K-pop dream got a fillip when she she watched Exo’s Growl MV and tried to copy the members’ moves  During Covid in 2020 she had to practice on the roof of her house and learn how to make audition videos from YouTube  When she started auditioning, she learnt Korean online and watched a lot of Korean dramas to learn both the language and culture Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, said he was overjoyed after hearing that his daughter would be the first Indian to be a K-pop star  “Though I had faith on her hard work, I never expected that Sriya would make it  Despite all my misgivings about her future, I encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing as she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said Lenka K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music  As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in the 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youngsters, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists

However, in the new video, between the old clips of the members, a fitness trainer was seen teaching exercises to ARMY to keep themselves fit. Workout with BTS is a five-day fitness program, part of BTS’ educational projects with HYBE EDU. Taking to Twitter, upset ARMY expressed their views on the video. Reacting to HYBE's tweet, a fan commented, ""Yes!! This is how our expectations fall from the 7th sky."" ""Using my man as a clickbait...ugh,"" tweeted another person.

A person tweeted, ""The exercise routine is so beautiful, I liked how they explained to us step by step how much we should do each exercise, it's so nice to see that they care about our health, so let's take these data into account, the boys are so cute."" ""I thought they will teach us recording their workout session and I thought of drooling over them instead of working out and burn my fat seeing their hotness.

53,"BTS member V, who is also known by his real name Kim Taehyung, has been a globally loved superstar  Being one of the BTS members has obviously earned him the due fame that he has worked hard for ever since his debut in 2013, however, his &lsquo;social butterfly&rsquo; self and unbounded charisma has let him explore different opportunities  One of these was his K-drama acting debut with &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Since then, V has not taken up any acting projects and has continued to promote with BTS as it grew humongous on a global scale and dipped into little solo work, including the creation of his solo album which is expected to be released sometime soon  However, the demand for his return continues, maybe growing bigger with time as fans root for more &lsquo;actor V&rsquo; 

BTS&rsquo; V in Hwarang

V was the first from BTS to delve into K-drama acting after his debut and did so with KBS2&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth&rsquo;  Alongside the leads of Park Seo Joon, Park Hyung Sik, Go Ara and a cast full of popular actors like Choi Min Ho, Seo Yea Ji, V became the maknae everyone adored  In the character of Seok Han Sung, he was the youngest as also in real life, adding to the fun 

While the show ended with V&rsquo;s character (SPOILER ALERT) Han Sung&rsquo;s dramatic death, it was a scene that will be remembered in the BTS fandom for a long time  A lot of praise went to the K-pop star as it was his first attempt at acting in a K-drama, seemingly seeing a lot of effort and emotion in action  As one of the Hwarang men, he trained endlessly and carried a jolly attitude becoming a favourite of everyone  Everyone talked about his relationship with Park Seo Joon&rsquo;s character&nbsp;as they expressed camaraderie beyond on-screen presence  V became best friends with actors Park Seo Joon and Park Hyung Sik after the filming was done and they came together with actor Choi Woo Shik and musician Peakboy to form the Wooga Squad  On the other hand, his on-screen friendship Go Ara&rsquo;s character was also a fan favourite 

Most popular Korean celebrities on IMDb

While the list was recently made public, what caught the netizens&rsquo; attention was spotting BTS&rsquo; V on it at a very high position  Essentially, a ranking of sorts gauging people&rsquo;s interest in Korean celebrities related to films, it was unexpected to spot the name of Kim Taehyung in it as he has never previously acted in a movie  While BTS themselves have released various cinematic collections of their concerts and their journey in the music world, none were ones that had them showcase their acting to the audience &nbsp;

First on the list is Park Chan Wook, the director behind mindblowing creations like &lsquo;The Handmaiden&rsquo;, &lsquo;Oldboy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thirst&rsquo; and more recently, &lsquo;Decision to Leave&rsquo;  One of the most prominent personalities in the world of Korean film, he has upheld his name for quite a long time now  His depth in terms of understanding various dark stories and bringing them to life has been appreciated by critics globally  Leading the list is a very obvious pick for the 59 year old whose work people always look forward to 

Following closely behind is director Bong Joon Ho who has become a pioneer in the movie industry thanks to his contribution to internationally acclaimed projects like &lsquo;Memories of Murder&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Host&rsquo;, &lsquo;Snowpiercer&rsquo;, &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parasite&rsquo;  The last one earned a Palme d&#39;Or and 3 Academy Awards making quite the roar across the film fraternity  Known for his black humour and socially unique topics, he occupies the rightful second place on the list 

Steven Yeun grabs the third position owing to his notable roles in films like &lsquo;Okja&rsquo; and &lsquo;Burning&rsquo; as well as the TV show, &lsquo;The Walking Dead&rsquo;  He established himself with varied roles that allowed him to be considered for unique characters  His nomination as the first Asian-American actor at the Screen Actors Guild for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role has been immensely written about 

V takes fourth place on the popularity list thanks to his acting in &lsquo;Hwarang&rsquo; as well as the online presence he has built so far with his elegant, relatable and all-giving nature  Multiple international directions have previously expressed their interest to cast him  While he is yet to sign any films, fans are definitely looking forward to actor Kim Taehyung making a return to their screens sooner rather than later

58,"On January 4, popular tattoo artist POLYC, who worked with BTS&rsquo; Jungkook first for all his major tattoos and went on to work with the other members for their group friendship tattoo which represents their long lasting friendship and brotherhood  While RM, J-Hope, Jin, Jimin and Jungkook had revealed their tattoos earlier, V was his latest post  He gave a close up on the pretty tattoo located above the knee, which was previously revealed through his personal Instagram post &nbsp;

About SUGA&#39;s tattoo:

He even talked about the awaited reveal of SUGA&rsquo;s tattoo  In his post, he said that he will be revealing the tattoo once Suga uploads it himself, in order to maintain the will of the customer  It has been debated on Twitter and other platforms by ARMYs when SUGA will be making an official reveal of the tattoo  Many suspect it is behind his ear, based on zooming in to a lot of his recent photos but nothing has been confirmed &nbsp;

In the V&rsquo;s post, POLYC wrote, &ldquo;Since I uploaded V&rsquo;s tattoo, I will upload SUGA&rsquo;s tattoo after he reveals it first  This is BTS&rsquo; friendship tattoo &lsquo;7&rsquo;  Hello  This is POLYC, a tattooist  With the attention of many, BTS members&#39; friendship tattoo work has been carried out  After a sufficient discussion with the members to show the meaning of friendship between BTS members, I have been working with them  No commercial sales will be made through the friendship tattoo design, and BTS&rsquo; friendship tattoo will not be worked for anyone other than the members to keep it for good &rdquo;

The BTS&#39; Pins:

On January 3, he revealed 7 gorgeous pins with black, gold and silver trim, showing BTS as the combined tattoos  The pretty pins have been presented as a gift to them as a sign of gratitude  In the post, he wrote, &ldquo;Personally made seven of these in a meaning of gratitude and respect as a present for the members  Not for sale &rdquo; In response to the post, many ARMYs took to the comments and praised the artist for not selling the art piece, rather leaving it for the members to enjoy and remember by  There have been many instances where ARMYs have gotten the same tattoos as their biases without giving it a second thought but this time, it remains as a bond shared by these 7 members &nbsp;

V showed off his sense of scratching the back of his hand, which was bitten by mosquitoes, in the form of V&#39;s signature painting, bringing laughter  In the photo, where he is smiling and covering his upper body with a towel with his hair wet in sea water, V&#39;s strong and lean body and long arms and legs drew attention  Wearing his swimsuit, the 7 tattoos of friendship with his members were clearly visible on his left thigh &nbsp;

It was reported that V was filming a new TVN entertainment program called &#39;Seojin&#39;, which was conducted in Mexico in strict secrecy, resulting in a hot topic  On social media, V&#39;s appearance with his best friend Park Seo Joon at a restaurant in Mexico, taking a walk, looking at toys in the market, or walking down the street wearing the same clothes with Lee Seo Jin, Jung Yu Mi, Park Seo Joon and Choi Woo Shik, fans are excited 

His message for Jungkook:

He began the series with Jungkook&rsquo;s posts about his tattoo cover ups and the BTS&rsquo; tattoo  In the post he said that having a long conversation with Jungkook before going on the tattoo, he covered up the parts that need to be complemented, both in terms of quality and in terms of quality  Many people who have come up to him put a lot of meanings in the picture when they are getting a tattoo, but Junglook also filled up with meaningful tattoos one by one 

All art may have its likes and dislikes, but he has done his best to cover up the arms of a world-class artist, and he has done a small part to become a tattooist suitable for him  He also had a pleasant working time and thanked Jungkook once again for being satisfied with the work that is currently covered up  He said that he will do his best to ensure that his nickname engraved on Jungkook&#39;s arm will be left with a good meaning 

He went on to show RM, Jin, Jimin and&nbsp; J-Hope&rsquo;s tattoos which have been placed in different parts of his body  Here&rsquo;s to hoping we see SUGA&rsquo;s tattoo soon!&nbsp;

The young lady thought she knew him when they made eye contact. It seems he was standing just beside her admiring the art. It looks like RM aka Kim Namjoon wore a mask and she said that identified him with his laugh The ARMY fan girl took to social media to describe her experience. She said that she respected his private time, and did not bother for pics or an autograph. But they clicked a few pictures of the space, and he has been captured in one of them. It seems RM was pretty cool with the public  at the museum. As per the fan girl, he observed the other art enthusiasts in the museum. Take a look at her tweets This is not the first time BTS fans working in art spaces have seen Namjoon. The girl from the Boston Art Museum also spoke about him being super attentive and respectful.

61,"BTS members seem to be using Instagram as their new group chat. From discussing on meeting up for drinks to talks on strawberries, Instagram is now their go to place. BTS member SUGA aka Min Yoongi is not very active on Instagram. Make no mistake his posts get better engagement than others. Yesterday, he decided to make his debut with the comments section. He asked RM aka Kim Namjoon what size would he (SUGA) need to buy of the jogger pants. As we know, BTS HYBE merch is driving fans crazy. RM had designed jogger pants and a wind chime. The jogger pants are out of stock but we guess as a BTS member SUGA has his privileges RM told him that SUGA wore L while he was XL. In his second comment, RM said he could have asked this size related information on group chat rather than on Instagram. Needless to say, fans began discussing how the boys use Instagram as  group chat nowadays. Many were shocked to know that SUGA buys clothing in size L. Others pointed out that he has broad shoulders unlike other members. RM has buffed up immensely so it is not surprising that he needs XL. After all, most fans know him as 'Little Kitten' and 'Smol Bean' . Fans also reminisced about the time RM said that SUGA and he wore same size underwear. After living together for 11 years, they are as familiar to each other as husband and wife. In fact, RM had once said that if he did not like his impulsive buys he could easily pass them to SUGA as they wear same size ARMY cannot get over this #NamGi interaction. RM's idea to put this on Kakao Talk is perhaps because he guessed what kind of conversation it would inspires in ARMYs. The septet is assumed to get back to work by end of January 2022. This is the first time that they're spending time with families in holiday season.

66,"BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival.

SUGA released a teaser video of 'Schwita' through BTS's official social media  In the teaser video, which pays homage to the 'Daechwita' music video scene, Suga is seen having a drink with a guest and having a conversation 

About SUGA:

SUGA and Agust D is a South Korean rapper, songwriter and record producer  Managed by BIGHIT MUSIC, he debuted as a member of the South Korean boy band BTS in 2013  In 2016, he released his first solo mixtape, Agust D  In 2018, he re-released the mixtape for digital purchase and streaming  The reissue reached number three on Billboard's World Albums Chart  In 2020, he released his second solo mixtape, D-2  Commercially, the mixtape peaked at number 11 on the US Billboard 200, number seven on the UK Albums Chart, and number two on Australia's ARIA Album Chart  The Korea Music Copyright Association attributes over 100 songs to SUGA as a songwriter and producer, including Suran's Wine which peaked at number two on the Gaon Music Chart and won best Soul/R&B track of the year at the 2017 Melon Music Awards

With 'Daechwita' and 'D-2', Suga became the first Korean solo artist to simultaneously enter the US Billboard's main single chart and main album chart 

Here are some of the highlight moments from the first episode:- 

1  RM and SUGA’s intro clip

As RM enters the screen, he begins with congratulating SUGA on beginning his YoutTube career and they talk about their pre-debut activities as well as being vloggers  Their sweet interactions show how close they are and their bond  

2  SUGA being proud of RM

SUGA congratulates RM on creating 200 songs with the release of the solo album and RM humbly counters with SUGA’s achievements which he deflects and we get to see two humble artists trying to put the other one up on the pedestal  Suga also delves into seeing RM during the album making process  RM also revealed that J-Hope was the first and only one to listen to the entire album before release and he said that it was because J-Hope got him to listen to his solo album Jack In The Box before the release  Being someone who does not reveal his work before release, he felt like he owed him that, which is such a sweet gesture 

3  RM talks about his album

He said that he began creating tracks for Indigo in 2018 or 2019 between the group and solo schedules and essentially created a 2019-2022 diary that encompassed all his feelings and thoughts of nearing the end of his 20s, which is captured beautifully in the song Forg_tful with Kim Sawol, a talented folk artist  He also talked about writing Wild Flower while he was taking a long walk in Seoul one night and used the environment as an inspiration for him 

4  SUGA talks about Daechwita 

As RM talks about struggling with writing lyrics sometimes, SUGA delves into talking about his Daechwita writing process and said that since it was created earlier, writing the second verse was always harder and hurried to finish the song  

5  RM takes inspiration from Adele 

While talking about the album name, he said that since he used to wear a lot of black, he called his album mono  while after release, he started wearing many colors, which inspired him to name his album Indigo  He also pointed out how Adele named her albums based on the age of when she wrote and finds himself similar to her 

6  They talk about 2025 

RM talks about that by 2025, he would be back from military service and would create songs for the members who would still be doing their service and want themselves to not be scared for the future and rather be present  He also presents 2025 as a monumental year as the ground-breaking album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life would complete 10 years and would do something special for that year

85,"The BTS members have everything going for them- the music, the fans, the visuals, the vocals, and now even the brands  The South Korean icons&rsquo; global influence has seen no bounds in recent years  From taking over international venues with thousands in the audience to doing a free concert in their home ground, the group has flaunted its massive presence, and rightly so  With such an impact, brand deals are bound to come knocking on their doors without hesitation  While earlier the seven would sign all contracts together, their June 2022 announcement where they revealed plans of also focusing on solo endeavors were revealed, opened more doors for the members 

BTS&rsquo; journey with Louis Vuitton

In 2019, the South Korean group first worked with the fashion house for their outfits while doing album promotions  However, 2021 marked the group&rsquo;s official start with the label as they were roped as in the global brand ambassadors  The septet also rocked then-Artistic Director Virgil Abloh&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2021 collection  It is being said that the contract between the fashion house and the group is now up after 2 years of successful collaborations 

Jimin with Dior

On January 16, BTS member Jimin was announced as the official global brand ambassador for the French luxury fashion house  Reports point out that he is officially the 18th current ambassador for the brand and the 1st Asian male celeb to be named so  This deal follows the group&rsquo;s long-running history with the brand as Dior had designed the members&rsquo; stage outfits for their &lsquo;Love Youself: Speak Yourself&rsquo; world tour back in 2019  Jimin&rsquo;s oomph in carrying his outfits makes him a perfect fit for the brand 

SUGA with Valentino

Known as the rapper of the group, member SUGA of BTS is so much more  From providing his meaningful insights to his chart-topping productions, he has been leading the group&rsquo;s success in multiple ways alongside the other six  Following his recent visit to Los Angeles where a special collaboration between him and the Italian luxury fashion house was announced, on January 17 he was officially declared as the brand&rsquo;s newest brand ambassador  He will join the group of people known as Di Vas, an acronym for Different Values that they hope to endorse with their products  The BTS member will be helming the Maison Valentino Essentials campaign with which he aims to propagate his shared values of diversity alongside the brand 

Will J-Hope continue with Louis Vuitton?

On the same day, Louis Vuitton announced that J-Hope will be heading to the 2023 Paris Fashion Week to attend the brand&rsquo;s Men&#39;s Fall-Winter 2023 Fashion Show on January 19  The BTS member has previously teased his possible partnership with the brand through Instagram stories shared on his account in the past week  It also seems that a new solo fashion project with the &lsquo;Jack In The Box&rsquo; singer is in the work and will likely take his own famed style quotient into consideration 

Member Jimin is also expected to join J-Hope on his visit to the Paris Fashion Week for his own promotions ahead of the former&rsquo;s upcoming solo debut  Apart from these, there have been no confirmed signed deals with any brands for the rest of the members  Here&rsquo;s what we can expect in the coming days 

RM for Bottega Veneta

A probable plan for signing the BTS leader could be in the works for the Italian brand which was seen throughout RM&rsquo;s &lsquo;Indigo&rsquo; promotions  While it is possible that Kim Namjoon chose his outfits based on his own preferences rather than a fashion deal, fans are hoping that the smart styling becomes the right fit for him  To add to their beliefs they&rsquo;ve found out that Matthieu Blazy, the creative director, and Dario Gargiulo, the chief marketing and digital business officer of Bottega Veneta started following the BTS member recently 

V for Celine

It is more likely than not that the BTS member signs with the French luxury brand following his solo gig alongside BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Lisa and Park Bo Gum last year which went viral for all the right reasons  V is known to harbour a special liking for the brand and can easily carry their confident fits with flair  Fans are also hoping that he signs with Gucci which has a more fancy style, going perfectly well with the K-pop star 

Jungkook for Versace

The youngest from the group was spotted in a fabulous fit from the brand for his performance at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony  It went well with the expensive but pleasing look that the BTS member is known to admire  They also have edgier options for when Jungkook wishes to do different and following the group&rsquo;s meeting with Donatella Versace at the 64th GRAMMY Awards, it seems more than likely 

Jin for Cartier

While the oldest member is currently serving in the military and will not sign anything until he&rsquo;s back, fans are rooting for Jin&nbsp;to land a deal with Cartier with whom they think he would be the best fit &nbsp;

BTS comprises RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. Speaking with Hits1 LA, Vernon responded to the comparison with BTS, ""When we debuted, BTS wasn’t the BTS today either. So, it’s really crazy what we’re doing right now and where we are right now."" Reacting to the video shared on the radio station's YouTube channel, fans criticised the question. A person wrote, ""There’s no comparison because they both have such amazing talent, so why compare them? I think they handled that question very well considering it just seems..ignorant? Like no research was done for them."" Another person commented, ""When are they going to stop comparing groups? This interview is so disappointing and humiliating.

SEVENTEEN debuted with the extended play (EP) 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US. It was also the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's 10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015 list. SEVENTEEN has released four studio albums, twelve EPs and three reissues.

88,"BTS is going to enlist in the Korean military with Jin being the first to head after releasing his solo song by end of October. It seems he has made up his mind to go at the earliest. The Bangtan Boys are looking at coming together and working as a group from mid 2025. It seems Jungkook will be the last one to go. He has been working on a solo album. Now, fans are coping up with this separation news in varied ways. Many have been very critical of the South Korean Government for not acknowledging the efforts of the boy band in promoting the nation's culture In the mean time, some Korean fans are worried that Jungkook being the adventurous man he is, might decide to join the Navy, marines or Airforce. The tenure there is longer. They have been writing small notes on social media for Jungkook to make him promise that he will only stick to the Army and be back. It looks like Jin, RM, JHope and SUGA are now only eligible for the ARMY and not combat missions. But K-ARMYs are worried about Jungkook who might want to challenge himself. Take a look at the tweets This is not all. It means people are buying purple rubber sandals too. In Korea, women wear white rubber sandals in the period when their partners are away for military enlistment. This time, the demand is for ones in purple colour We can see how BTS ARMY is doing everything to shower love for their precious seven boys.

89,"BTS and military enlistment has been a burning topic. The boys announced that they are on a group hiatus and would continue with solo activities for a while. Many felt this was because of the impending military enlistment. Now, South Korea's defence minister Lee Jong-sup has dropped a statement, which is quite interesting. He has said that the boys can perform at global concerts in their enlistment period. The minister made this comment on Monday in the middle of a debate on whether military service for K-Pop stars should be shortened to three weeks. As of now, the period is close to two years. In South Korea, every able-bodied male in the age group of 18-28 must join the South Korean army In December, Kim Seokjin aka Jin who is the eldest of the BTS boys will turn 30. He has to enlist in the military by January 2023. Before that, the boys will perform at the global concert in Busan which is a promotional bid for the World Expo in 2030. Since 2019, there is a revision due to which popstars can defer military service till the age of 30. As we know, military service is a must as the country has threat from North Korea, which is one of the top five nuclear powers in the world. Only few people have got exemptions or the chance to do a shorter service. They include Olympics and Asian Games medal winners and some classical musicians-dancer who win at prestigious international competitions like Chopin Piano Competition The Parliament is debating if a bill can be passed to shorten military service of K-Pop stars. The music industry rakes in billions for the economy in a year, and BTS is the biggest income generator. The pool of personnel resources in South Korea is decreasing due to low birth rates. This is due to a number of reasons ranging from cost of living to unwillingness of citizens to have babies Now, Big Hit Music has not commented on this statement made by the Minister. He was quoted as saying in the Korean media, ""Even if they join the military, there would be a way to give them a chance to practise and perform together if there are scheduled concerts abroad. As many people highly value (artists serving) in the military, that may help boost their popularity even more."" In April 2021, an official said that this uncertainly over military enlistment had caused mental stress to the Bangtan Boys. They are now doing solo work. We saw J-Hope's solo album and his performance at Lollapalooza in Chicago, which was a huge success This news item has left BTS ARMY with mixed reactions. One of them commented on Twitter, ""Like ""you got to do your military service and also work at the same time, because we want you to serve the military but don't want to lose the money that you bring to our country's economy. We don't care if you die of exhaustion as long as you bring us money and done your srvice"", while someone else wrote, ""Wowww. This is this INSANELY SELFISH. They want them to be burned out of exhaustion for doing two things - mandatory military service and work - concerts which are both phyiscally and mentally exhausting. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!""

LE SSERAFIM

HYBE&rsquo;s power-packed rookies have not had an easy year, however, they have continued to make sense of it all with a release that successfully showcased their skills  Grabbing the fourth spot, LE SSERAFIM has continued to stay relevant and amazing  Their latest, &lsquo;ANTIFRAGILE&rsquo;, has wowed the audiences thanks to a visually pleasing performance angle and the fabulous synchronisation the girls have displayed throughout the promotions  They are ready for a Japanese release next and the fans are awaiting a new side of their charms

Celebrating its 68th anniversary this year, the book boasts a staggering 138 million copies sold, with more than 3,500 new records published in more than 100 countries in more than 20 languages.

V&#39;s achievements:

On December 6 of last year, without notice, BTS opened individual Instagram accounts for each member and received enthusiastic responses. In particular, V attracted followers at a tremendous speed, recording 1 million followers in 43 minutes and 10 million followers in just 4 hours and 52 minutes, making it a Guinness World Record. He then broke the world record in the shortest time to reach 50 million followers, and on the 20th he became the first Korean male to reach 54 million followers.

A year later, the record is still unbroken. In addition to Guinness Records, V has set various records in the past year standing shoulder to shoulder with the world&#39;s top stars. Along with followers, in &#39;Like&#39;, the two most popular indicators, it set a record of exceeding 20 million &#39;Like&#39;, which only 10 people in the world have, and has 4.19 million &#39;Like&#39; posts for the first time in Asia.

V&#39;s popularity:

V received attention from all over the world by demonstrating a shining presence among numerous pop stars at the Grammy Awards ceremony.

The LA Times praised V&#39;s performance at the Grammy Awards, saying, &quot;V&#39;s performance at the Grammy Awards was worth a million dollars.&quot; &#39;MTV&#39; selected a scene in which V and Olivia Rodrigo performed a butter performance with the article &quot;April, what is most of my cell phone backgrounds?&quot; as the highlight moment of the pop world in April.

The news that Rihanna became a mother, the Super Bowl halftime show with Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar, the news that Billie Eilish and her brother Phineas O&#39;Connell won the Oscar as the youngest artist ever for the theme song &#39;No Time To Die&#39; for the 007 movie, etc. was selected as the hottest issue of the month.

V was selected as the most searched Asian in Google Trends in 2022, and recorded the most mentions right after the Grammy Awards ceremony, proving the hot interest poured into V that day.&nbsp;

Jimin&#39;s wish:

On December 30th, Jimin posted a picture without any text. In the published photos, Jimin and V were captured. Jimin and V are posing for the camera in the rain.

In 2019, Jimin put up some cute selfies of them together on V&rsquo;s birthday. For the first selfie, they were seen half in the water, a childish look selfie, them looking natural-faced and them together at the Niagara Falls.&nbsp;

J-Hope&#39;s wishes:

105,"Recalling his earlier mixtape, RM said that in 2015 he 'called out the rapper side of me I wanted to show off'. In 2018, he 'brought up my personal idols' to express his 'darker, gloomy side that I had been wanting to show'. He added that in 2022, he's hopeful and thinking that 'it might just be enough to convey something while being purely my sincere self'. In an interview with Weverse magazine, RM said, “I think I need to try taking a step away from myself for a minute. I think that way I’ll know what the work I’m doing right now means to me and what it is to me. So now I’m worried if I’m just doing the things I’m given and if I’m losing myself in a way. It was never my intention to live feeling this way, and I want to live an independent and active life, but now I’m starting to wonder if I’m living too passively because of the pandemic, and it’s unbearable. That includes how I felt at the Grammys, and I think I’ve hit a kind of wall. It’s something I felt when I looked at artists like Lady Gaga or H.E.R. who devote their entire lives to their music: We need a message so we can be sure and assert our own image, too.” He said that the Butter performance at the Grammy Awards astonished people and was unique. RM added that it’s time for BTS ‘to move beyond astonishing people and think again about what kind of messages we can send people now'. He also said, ""I think I should be making things that will shine even after time passes. I think I need to approach something that’s more timeless...If I just work without being aware of that, then I have a feeling that, with the way everything’s swept away so quickly now by everything coming out in that time under the fast-changing algorithm, the things I make might look outdated later. It really feels like everything is thrown out after just a few years with how fast the world changes, so it makes me think I want to attain some kind of everlastingness."" Recently, BTS released their anthology album Proof, comprising new as well as old tracks. A few days later, the group said they would take a break, during Festa dinner. HYBE, however, has clarified that BTS is not taking any hiatus.",never intention live feeling way want live independent active life i’m starting wonder i’m living passively pandemic it’s unbearable. devote entire life music need message sure assert image too.” said butter performance grammy awards astonished people unique. think need approach something that’s timeless...if work without aware feeling way everything’s swept away quickly everything coming time fastchanging algorithm thing make might look outdated later. ,recalling earlier mixtape said two thousand fifteen called rapper side wanted show off. two thousand eighteen brought personal idol express darker gloomy side wanting show. added two thousand twentytwo hopeful thinking might enough convey something purely sincere self. interview weverse magazine said think need try taking step away minute. think way i’ll know work i’m right mean me. i’m worried i’m thing i’m given i’m losing way. includes felt grammys think i’ve hit kind wall. it’s something felt looked artist like lady gaga h.e.r. added it’s time bts ‘to move beyond astonishing people think kind message send people now. also said think making thing shine even time passes. really feel like everything thrown year fast world change make think want attain kind everlastingness. recently bts released anthology album proof comprising new well old tracks. day later group said would take break festa dinner. hybe however clarified bts taking hiatus..

Fly BTS:
The aim of this episode is to make BTS take social media worthy photos  And the trick is that they need to learn how to do flying yoga poses  A special trainer is called in for the members as they stretch their muscles under the &lsquo;bora&rsquo;- purple, colored hammock 

The fast learners:
Member Jimin who is known to be the most flexible in the group is quick to grasp the core of the show as he easily mimics the steps  Youngest Jungkook is true to his Golden Maknae nickname, also finding it fairly interesting 

The slow learners:
Leader RM, though finding it difficult to control his core strength, manages to do most of the moves albeit huffing and puffing occasionally  V thinks that he has a special talent for the activity as he does not struggle much with most moves, however decides to take a break once he has reached his limit 

Struggling with every move:
Member Jin finds himself calling out for the trainer with cries of help as he takes on flying yoga  SUGA who has to be careful with his shoulder can also be seen screaming out in trouble over the many complex actions  Last but surely not the least, the most surprising revelation is dance leader J-Hope who learns that this is definitely not his cup of tea as he adorably maneuvers every move with wonder on his face and flailing limbs

The Tannies reject one of Jungkook's ideas during a photoshoot. And it's relatable and hilarious at the same time It so happened that the BTS members were shooting the concept photos for Festa 2021. And for the same, the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and JK – were seen in colourful outfits that made them look like cotton candies of different colours. They were all copying poses suggested by each of the BTS members. RM suggested a Michael Jackson posture, Hobi suggested a crab posture, and Suga had a cute posture, too. BTS V aka Kim Taehyung had the easiest one out of all. He suggested striking his signature V pose for the pictures Out of them all Jimin, Jungkook and Jin had difficult postures. Jimin's posture was that of sitting on a chair in the air. Jin's was a hard side-way lean which almost tripped Taehyung. But the most difficult of it all was Jungkook's posture. It was a Yoga posture wherein one balances his/her body on his hand. And right away, the idea was rejected by the members. It's funny and relatable at the same time. Jungkook is fond of exercising and working out. So are others but sometimes, the things that Jungkook does easily are difficult for the rest of the Bangtan Boys Meanwhile, during Festa Dinner this year, the BTS members announced that they will be taking a break from the hectic work schedule as the boyband.

126,"On the show, when RM was asked about his thoughts on marriage, he revealed he is ‘really scared’ about it. He added that people born in the 1990s are currently the ones who are scared of marriage. He who thought marriage was a natural process, now looks at it differently. According to a translation by Twitter handle @mybwits, Kim Namjoon said, “I’m really scared, and for now…I think it’s very long, promise and swear eternity with one person ‘Can something like that happen in my life?’ In the past, I thought it was one of the natural processes, I chose to live an unusual life. A sudden thought for the first time a few years ago..’Maybe I’m not getting married?!’ Can you get out of control because you have that thought once?"" Namjoon’s candid thoughts seemed to have found their way into the hearts of the fans. Many took to Twitter and thanked him for opening up about the topic. Some also found it relatable. One fan wrote, “Thank you so much Kim Namjoon for saying because I live in a country where marriage defines you as a person and I hate it here and I am scared of that word just because I can’t seem to see myself tied to a person to eternity.” “Namjoon talking about not being sure about marriage is so comforting dawg,” added another fan.

132,"Balming Tiger was fresh off of a live reaction, the first from them, for the SEXY NUKIM music video feat  RM of BTS, however, our pile of questions awaited, and kind as ever the seven of them were ready to answer them all 

Alternative K-pop band
Standing out from the rest, Balming Tiger defined themselves as “A Multi-National Alternative K-pop band and Asian Arts & Culture Collective ” On asking, the group uncovered the very reason they decided to use Alternative K-pop as their genre- they wished to be free from the shackles of set norms and put themselves under an umbrella that would allow them to continue making music of all kinds  Genius, we think 

Growing influence
Balming Tiger is very well aware of the millions riding Hallyu and in this storm of interest, they wish to make themselves and others like them constants in world music  Their goal? Longevity in the influence of Korean culture  And to take a step in the right direction, they brought in inarguably one of the most crucial elements characteristically anchoring the Korean wave - BTS - and worked with leader RM to be able to reach a wider audience and they’ve done just that as the song rocked atop multiple music charts 

Working with other artists
Collaborations come very naturally to the group, whose Omega Sapien shared the details of his solo work ‘Wrecker’ with SEVENTEEN’s Vernon  They’ve been friends for a while and a random meeting saw him suggest the idea to the same-aged K-pop star who happily agreed to be a part of the release 

On the other hand, roping in RM may not have been a tough mountain to climb either, as the collective’s leader, San Yawn, rubbed elbows with the very acclaimed producer, Supreme Boi, who has been credited for superhit tracks like ‘Dionysus’ and ‘Idol’ by BTS, and ‘Cat & Dog (English Version)’ by TOMORROW X TOGETHER, to name a few  San Yawn and Supreme Boi belong to the same alumnus that both decided to drop out of, a fact we cheered about during our talk  They’re both doing fabulously well, after all 

Their charm
Balming Tiger is not unknown to the Korean crowd who have previously grooved to their domestically viral release ‘Kolo Kolo’, which also happens to be our personal favourite  One look at their discography and you can easily notice that they’re quirky, full of ideas and oozing with talent- a part of which the unversed were able to witness through SEXY NUKIM 

During our conversation, the group dished about the many secret details of their collaborative song- how it was to be shot in another country originally, how they reacted to RM’s first try on his SEXY NUKIM verse, how different each of their experiences was while shooting the music video and how they acknowledge that this is only the start for them 

Over an hour of deep conversations, laughs and cultural exchange later- the collective was ready to hop on the plane for their show the next morning and we parted ways with their fascination about us deciding to “입덕” (ipdeok) aka stan them!

Hardly, it was very natural, just like their collaborations

134,"BTS and ARMY share a loving bond. On the occasion of Valentine’s Day, ARMYs go into the imagination mood. Well, many of them are in that frame of mind 365 days a year but V-Day further amplifies the feelings. BTS members RM, SUGA, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope or V rarely discuss their private lives or what they feel about love or romance. However, BTS ARMY can imagine what kind of boyfriends they did be or perhaps what would turn them in partners. In fact, some members like SUGA, Jin and Jungkook have said some truly romantic things in front of BTS ARMY that made hearts mushy. BTS leader RM can tease fans, that too in the most sophisticated of manner. And what would we say about Jimin and V. Many fans feel that Kim Taehyung is the God Of Romance and Seduction in BTS while Jimin is the lover who has a heart full of warmth. Just ahead of Valentine’s Day 2022, let us see the romantic quotient of the Bangtan Boys… BTS maknae Jeon Jungkook is quite a romantic. He once said he did do anything for the girl he loves. Jungkook also made fans feel mushy when he said he did like to recreate the epic kissing scene from the movie Love 911. This proves that he is quite a romantic at heart BTS member J-Hope has a passion for dance and keeping others happy. Jung Hoseok or Hobi is perceptive, hard-working and caring. ARMYs felt very sad when he revealed that he was dumped by his girlfriend in school. J-Hope loves romantic shows as they inspire his lyric-writing. He said he dreams of finding true love like the one seen on Crash Landing On You. Isn’t that too romantic? ARMYs can dream of that one epic love story knowing this fact about Hobi In an old video, BTS Jin has spoken about how he dreams of cooking food with his partner when he has one. In fact, he said that his food got burnt at times as he was too deep in the thought. If food is your language of love, then Kim Seokjin is your perfect Valentine’s Day date. He can make you a great meal, tell you dad jokes and go the extra mile to have you roll on the floor with laughter. BTS Jin is quite traditional in his ideals of love BTS rapper, music producer and songwriter SUGA is on a high. Old BTS ARMYs know that Min Yoongi has a way with words. He told fans to keep their fourth finger empty (for the marriage ring), and coolly asked for the documents when someone proposed to him. SUGA is always flooded with marriage proposals and why not. Min Yoongi can sing, play instruments, write you a song, prepare a nice meal and even take you for a long drive (he has a grade one driving license). SUGA has written some of the most romantic notes for fans some of which are part of old BTS archives. The letter written for his former girlfriend is a reflection of how he feels about relationships and love BTS front-man RM is admired by millions. A skilled rapper, composer, music producer and songwriter RM is the complete package. He can also be a tease if he wants to. Remember what he said to husbands of ARMYs on the Zoom pyjama party. Fans dream that a date with RM would mean a walk through a museum enjoying art or soaking in the sights of nature. He is a man who loves all the finer things of life. Though he has not spoken about his romantic side, ARMYs only imagine how life would be with a man as hot and intelligent as Kim Namjoon. He is the perfect Valentine’s Day date for all sapiosexuals BTS member V is known for his good looks, charisma and deep baritone. Whether it is Sweet Night from Itaewon Class or Christmas Tree from Our Beloved Summer, he is someone who has given some truly romantic OSTs. In fact, his video from Hawaii where he was singing Travel With Me while driving a Mustang conjured up images in the minds of ARMY on how romantic Kim Taehyung could be as a partner. From sharing pics of starlit skies to setting up thirst traps at 3 am posing shirtless, BTS V is known as the God of Seduction BTS Jimin is full of love, warmth and compassion. Jimin once said he wanted to meet the parents of ARMYs for giving birth to such loving fans. He is also someone to reach out with empathy and kindness. His recent note for a fan is proof. If you love kindness is a man, he is your perfect guy",,bts army share loving bond. occasion valentine’s day armys imagination mood. well many frame mind three hundred sixtyfive day year vday amplifies feelings. bts member suga jimin jin jungkook jhope rarely discus private life feel love romance. however bts army imagine kind boyfriend perhaps would turn partners. fact member like suga jin jungkook said truly romantic thing front bts army made heart mushy. bts leader tease fan sophisticated manner. would say jimin many fan feel kim taehyung god romance seduction bts jimin lover heart full warmth. ahead valentine’s day two thousand twentytwo let see romantic quotient bangtan boys… bts maknae jeon jungkook quite romantic. said anything girl loves. jungkook also made fan feel mushy said like recreate epic kissing scene movie love nine hundred eleven. prof quite romantic heart bts member jhope passion dance keeping others happy. jung hoseok hobi perceptive hardworking caring. armys felt sad revealed dumped girlfriend school. jhope love romantic show inspire lyricwriting. said dream finding true love like one seen crash landing you. isn’t romantic armys dream one epic love story knowing fact hobi old video bts jin spoken dream cooking food partner one. fact said food got burnt time deep thought. food language love kim seokjin perfect valentine’s day date. make great meal tell dad joke extra mile roll floor laughter. bts jin quite traditional ideal love bts rapper music producer songwriter suga high. old bts armys know min yoongi way words. told fan keep fourth finger empty marriage ring coolly asked document someone proposed him. suga always flooded marriage proposal not. min yoongi sing play instrument write song prepare nice meal even take long drive grade one driving license. suga written romantic note fan part old bts archives. letter written former girlfriend reflection feel relationship love bts frontman admired millions. skilled rapper composer music producer songwriter complete package. also tease want to. remember said husband armys zoom pyjama party. fans dream date would mean walk museum enjoying art soaking sight nature. man love finer thing life. though spoken romantic side armys imagine life would man hot intelligent kim namjoon. perfect valentine’s day date sapiosexuals bts member known good look charisma deep baritone. whether sweet night itaewon class christmas tree beloved summer someone given truly romantic osts. fact video hawaii singing travel driving mustang conjured image mind army romantic kim taehyung could partner. sharing pic starlit sky setting thirst trap three posing shirtless bts known god seduction bts jimin full love warmth compassion. jimin said wanted meet parent armys giving birth loving fans. also someone reach empathy kindness. recent note fan proof. love kindness man perfect guy.
